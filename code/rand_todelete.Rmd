## DAG {.tabset}
**DAG for choosing variables of interest**
`r knitr::include_graphics(here::here("data", "DAG.png"))`  
Should we try and account for situatuations where people indicated that they **teleworked more/less as a result of generally working more/less?**  
* Perhaps by including a variable showing the change in percentage that people worked at the time of the Inclusion questionnaire and at the time of the Santé-travail questionnaire?  
  
  
### Description of variables:  
**Outcomes:**  
* Linear regression  
  * Linear EE-MBI score
* Logistic regression  
  * Dichotomised EE-MBI score  
  * Diagnosed burnout
  
**Main exposure:** Composite variable `wfh_exposure` that combines two variables for WFH status and changes since the the pandemic:  

* `wfh_updated` re-categorized into three groups (Never, Not Possible, Yes) (`wfh_trich`)  
  * The `wfh_updated` variable was made from the `wfh` variable by cleaning the "Never" responses  
    * Cleaning process was to assign the most relevant ISCO-08 code I could find for each of the professions (only done for the "Never" responses).  
    * I then used a recently developed teleworkability index (https://joint-research-centre.ec.europa.eu/publications/teleworkability-and-covid-19-crisis-new-digital-divide_en) to assign a score for the physical feasibility of teleworking (from 0 to 1, where 0 = not at all physically feasible, up to 1 where it's completely physically feasible).  
    * "Never" responses were updated to "Not possible" under the following conditions:  
      * Physical feasibility of teleworking = 0  
      * Occupation category is one of: "Air traffic controllers", "Ambulance workers","Fire-fighters", "Food processing and related trades workers", "Medical assistants", "Stock clerks", "Physiotherapists", "Dentists"  
      * Occupation category is "Protective services workers" & profession is not "Fonctionnaire"  
      * Profession is "Vendeuse"  
      * Occupation category is "Life science technicians and related associate professionals" & profession is not "Assistante diplômée"  
* `wfh_change` which gives an indication of whether or not their WFH frequency changed over the pandemic (increase, no change, decrease)

**Other explanatory variables of interest:** These have all been queried in the inclusion questionnaire  

* `age_cat`
* `sex_en`
* `education_rec_en`
* `hh_income_cat_en`
* `finance_situation`
* `hh_livewith_rec_en`
* `overcrowded` --> Number of people living in the dwelling divided by the number of bedrooms (ratio > 2 = "Overcrowded")
* `noisy`
* `quiet_room` --> has access to a quiet room in the dwelling
* `health_general_dich`  
  
  
```{r}
# define main exposure and other explanatory variables of interest - can be used for linear and logistic regressions
mcovariates <- c("wfh_exposure",
                 "age_cat","sex_en","education_rec_en",
                 "hh_income_cat_en", "finance_situation", # which variable to use for financial security? or too linked with income?
                 "hh_livewith_rec_en", "overcrowded", # "zone_house" to be added as well?
                 "noisy", "quiet_room",
                 # "work_interruption",
                 "health_general_dich"
                 )
```
  
  
From "Essential Medical Statistics":  
**Estimating the effect of a particular exposure**  
_When estimating the effect of a particular exposure, we have seen that it is important to include potential confounding variables in the regression model, and that failure to do so will lead to a biased estimate of the effect. In considering which potential confounders should be included, it is essential that careful consideration be given to hierarchical relationships between exposures and confounders, as well as to statistical associations in the data. This is explained in detail in Chapter 38 on strategies for data analysis._

**Developing an explanatory model for the outcome**  
_Sometimes the focus of a study is to understand the aetiology of the outcome, and to identify those exposures or risk factors that are important influences on it. The purpose of the regression model here is halfway between that of the other two situations just described. Thus the focus is neither on identifying which confounders to include for a particular risk factor, nor is it on identifying any combination of exposures that works, as in the prediction scenario. Instead it is intended to attach meaning to the variables chosen for inclusion in the final model. For this reason, we strongly recommend that the selection procedure is based on an underlying conceptual framework (see Chapter 38 for more detail), and that formal stepwise methods are avoided_
